Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

Examples :

Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output: 11
Explanation: The array can be modified as {3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11. 
Constraints
1 ≤ k ≤ 107
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

        n = len(arr)
        arr.sort()
        
        res = arr[n-1] - arr[0]
        
        
        for i in range(1,len(arr)):
            if arr[i] - k < 0:
                continue
            
            minH = min(arr[0] + k,arr[i] - k)
            
            maxH = max(arr[i - 1] +k,arr[n-1]-k)
            
            res = min(res,maxH - minH)
        
        return res
