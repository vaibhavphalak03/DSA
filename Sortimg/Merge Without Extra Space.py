'''
Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively, the task is to merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify a[] so that it contains the first n elements and modify b[] so that it contains the last m elements.

Examples:

Input: a[] = [2, 4, 7, 10], b[] = [2, 3]
Output:
2 2 3 4
7 10
Explanation: After merging the two non-decreasing arrays, we get, 2 2 3 4 7 10
Input: a[] = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20], b[] = [2, 3, 8, 13]
Output:
1 2 3 5 8 9
10 13 15 20
Explanation: After merging two sorted arrays we get 1 2 3 5 8 9 10 13 15 20.
Input: a[] = [0, 1], b[] = [2, 3]
Output:
0 1
2 3
Explanation: After merging two sorted arrays we get 0 1 2 3.
Constraints:
1 <= a.size(), b.size() <= 105

        while i >= 0 and j < len(b):
            if a[i] < b[j]:
                i -= 1
                
            else:
                a[i],b[j] = b[j],a[i]
                i -= 1
                j += 1
                
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
